            <h5>Wednesday, Jun 1, 2022</h5>
            <h5>Sunny</h5>
            <p>The exams are over. For the past few weeks, I've been working on the exam reviews, and didn't have time to put any entries. Nevertheless, nothing really happened, so it doesn't really matter that much.</p>
            <p>Exam returns are today, and I've had most of my exams back. I would edit this entry later on to add my final grades for the exams. Generally speaking, except for the stupid mistakes in math that brought my grade down to a 6, everything else worked out fine.</p>
            <p>Speaking of exam returns, based on the results I got I was able to project an expected grade. Judging by my current grades, it should be somewhere around 97.8. This isn't the best nor worst case scenario, and there's plenty of space to adjust on both ends. In either case, I guess we'll find out whether or not I got the award for highest GPA in a few days.</p>
            <p>The flight to China is basically secured. Unless I catch covid last-minute here, it seems pretty unlikekly that we're not going back. We adjusted the flight to Toronto to be on this Sunday, June 5th, along with Leo Sun and Amanda Li and their respective families.</p>
            <p>Awards ceremony just banned me from entrance and I'm now waiting for my dad to deliver the proper "dress code". Why is dress code even a thing...? Anyways, doesn't actually matter.</p>
            <p>Hosted a middle school Reach For The Top tournament the other week, everything went well, and stuff were according to plan. An RNS team came on top, obviously. I see some pretty hopeful future within our school's new generation of Reach players.</p>
            <p>It's getting late and I can barely see my computer screen. I'll end it here.</p>
            <p class="anger">English Final: 7</p>
            <p class="anger">French, Science, Math Final: 6</p>
            <p class="anger">History Final: 6.9</p>

            <h5>Thursday, May 12, 2022</h5>
            <h5>Sunny</h5>
            <p>It's been a while since my last entry. Quite some stuff happened.</p>
            <p>First of all, I'm officially in exam prep. I'm not sure what to expect from the exam, definitely a bit stressed and nervous right now, but hopefully everything will be in control.</p>
            <p>For the trip back to China, there might be some issues. Air Canada is cutting down 40% of the passengers, so we're deciding by a draw for the spots on the plane, and I'm completely oblivious about my covid situation. If anything goes wrong, I would not be able to return. The good news is my grandparents are mentally prepared for it.</p>
            <p>I went to watch the school play last week. The title is <em>She Kills Monsters</em>, and it's about DND. I hope they could've added more DND elements, like the actual dice, but overall its pretty good. The crew is taking off today to go to Dramafest.</p>
            <p>Finished most of my assignments now. The final math project was to redesign a school building, I chose the squash court with Seven and Isaac, and we put together a blueprint, a budget, and a video. For the CE final project I did pygame, and I finished that as well, took a few all-nighters. I made it another euphemism about the communist movement in the 20th century and its eventual failure. There are also some other minor projects that happened.</p>
            <p>Finished the book <em>Born A Crime</em> by Trevor Noah. I can't say I liked the book in particular, but it also wasn't that terrible. I guess no books are terrible after <em>The Marrow Thieves</em>, absolute trash.</p>
            <p>Also, we won the school competition for the My Money My Future challenge, so we're going provincial. Need to talk to Leo again about whether we will send that cringe video of me or record a new one.</p>
            <p>Debate Nationals also happened. We didn't exactly win (nobody in RNS did, Cole and Bex did pretty well though), but I got some stuff out of it. I can now improve my debate styles and use rhetoric a lot more effectively than before.</p>
            <p>On another note, Beth McDade is confirmed to leave to the Netherlands. It's hard (but also easy) to imagine that someone who I've gotten used to be around will never be seen again. Ever. I guess that's just how life works sometimes. The same applies to the grade 12s, Yihong, Cole, Cindy, Melissa... I probably will never see even one of them again.</p>
            <p>It's no time to be emotional, not yet. I have more work to do. I'll end this entry here.</p>

            <h5>Monday, April 25, 2022</h5>
            <h5>Cloudy</h5>
            <p>New page! The last week was terribly busy.</p>
            <p>First of all, Heads Cup was finished, and I <em>won</em>. I get absolutely nothing, but my name does go on the wall in dining hall, so I guess its decent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, robotics happened. We didn't do that great because the sensors weren't calibrated perfectly, but I'm not that worried about it. The issue doesn't worry me because we're not gonna be placed anyways.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, reach provincials happened. We won exactly 0 rounds, all the teams were pretty strong. Only one team was decently on-our-level, but we still lost with a tiny margin. However, our Intermediate and Junior teams did pretty well in general. I see some hope in the future.</p>
            <p>Some stuff that I thought was supposed to happen last week ended up not happening. Discovery presentation was pushed to today, and chess regionals was cancelled. Instead, we're going straight to provincials this week Sunday.</p>
            <p>Nats is also this week. So that's fun. A prep session happened yesterday at Cole's place, it wasn't that effective but I got some stuff out of it.</p>
            <p>Finally, on Wednesday there is going to be a book talk. I'm going to be presenting. That means I need to stay at school from 330pm to 900pm. <EM>LITERALLY CANNOT WAIT.</EM></p>
            <p>Still in CE right now getting taught about HTML. Guess I'll end it here.</p>
