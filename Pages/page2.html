            <h5>Cloudy</h5>
            <p>New page! The last week was terribly busy.</p>
            <p>First of all, Heads Cup was finished, and I <em>won</em>. I get absolutely nothing, but my name does go on the wall in dining hall, so I guess its decent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, robotics happened. We didn't do that great because the sensors weren't calibrated perfectly, but I'm not that worried about it. The issue doesn't worry me because we're not gonna be placed anyways.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, reach provincials happened. We won exactly 0 rounds, all the teams were pretty strong. Only one team was decently on-our-level, but we still lost with a tiny margin. However, our Intermediate and Junior teams did pretty well in general. I see some hope in the future.</p>
            <p>Some stuff that I thought was supposed to happen last week ended up not happening. Discovery presentation was pushed to today, and chess regionals was cancelled. Instead, we're going straight to provincials this week Sunday.</p>
            <p>Nats is also this week. So that's fun. A prep session happened yesterday at Cole's place, it wasn't that effective but I got some stuff out of it.</p>
            <p>Finally, on Wednesday there is going to be a book talk. I'm going to be presenting. That means I need to stay at school from 330pm to 900pm. <EM>LITERALLY CANNOT WAIT.</EM></p>
            <p>Still in CE right now getting taught about HTML. Guess I'll end it here.</p>
