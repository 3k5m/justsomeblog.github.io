## Reporting a Vulnerability

There are not many explicit issues on this blog, so security isn't my main concern. 

However, if there is a security issue that you think you would need to report, send an email to suruiquan10@163.com. I would reply to the email within 2 days if I received it. Please do the same thing if some of my features could (or are) being exploited to immoral or criminal activities.
