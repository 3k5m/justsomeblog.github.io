        <p>Helped my dad clean the back yard of snow this morning. Fixed some issues with the blog. Finished correcting philosophy essays. Did some further research regarding debate.</p>
        <p>Played minecraft. Watched anime, which I will get to in a bit. Dinner was veggie pizza and meat, delicious as always.</p>
        <p>The debate topic this time ("This House would support a ban on cryptocurrency") is sort of hard to prep for. I have no idea what crypto is, but now I generally have something along the lines of a case. Talking to Shreyas, my partner, on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Regarding the anime, it's called Erased（只有我不在的街道）, recommended by Umar. It was really good. Finished it in an afternoon, about 12 episodes. The plot was near perfect.</p>
        <p>还有你们能不能别再说什么范式狂喜，牛头人之类的啊，这东西跟牛头人根本不沾边好吧，怎么看八代和男主都没什么浪漫感情啊，差不多一点啊你们这些人，我都哭了然后看评论区全是“牛头人”真的很破坏气氛啊喂</p>
        <p>Happy new year! Next year I'll be someone else. I will work harder. I will push myself harder. Most importantly, I'll be a better person. Those are my resolutions.</p>
        <br><p>Oh and also, I feel like I can start doing the K3 from the Keep App tomorrow in temrs of physical exercise.</p>

        <h5>Cloudy</h5> 
        <p>Sleepy as heck, tried for an afternoon to add pages to this website and failed. Formatting error. Guess I'll use collapse instead for now.</p>
        <p>Did some more philosophy work and carried on with my daily routine. All should be good. Driving class got cancelled because teacher was sick. Hopefully its not CoVID.</p>

      <p>Hopefully the blog gives me someone to talk to.</p>
      <p>Finished some stuff in my philosophy course. Carried on my daily routine.</p>
      <p>Dinner was delicious. Ate some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanghulu" target="_blank">Chinese dessert</a>, maybe I need to work out more.</p>
      <p>Finished the book Mao's Great Famine. Have a few opinions on it that I need to tell McEvoy.</p>
      <p>Expecting to finish the current unit of the philosophy course during the winter break.</p><br>
      <p>Oh and HTML compiles top to bottom, doesn't read the entire script beforehand. Got stuck on the header issue for like 1 hour because of this.</p>
