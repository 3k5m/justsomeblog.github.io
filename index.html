      <h5>Raining/Cloudy</h5> 
      <p>Not much happened. Had my second driving lesson, coach is feeling better and said I need to practice turning more. Finish the philosophy unit. I'm writing this at 1 AM in the morning.</p>
      <p>The reason I'm still up at this hour is Sherry Nolan, she changed the debate resolution for provincials to something new completely. Prepping my ass off right now.</p>
      <p>0 Ground for government case. I don't even know how she can persistently come up with new trashier resolutions. Sherry Nolan never fails to disappoint. Here's a pic of what I have so far.</p>

      <p>Also, snowstorm tomorrow. Gonna grind my case I guess, originally planning to go practice driving at QPlex.</p>

      <p>Literally nothing happened today. French class happened. I made this entry to remind myself of how bad covid is. I will write the following in two languages.</p>
      <p>Covid can and have (from the very 1st case) affect other organs than the lungs and the respiratory system. Cases have been reported where covid affected the brain. It is also possible that covid cannot be detected by any means of covid testing that exists in the present day. In fact, covid tests are only 50% accurate. All vaccines are void against the omicron variant. A woman died in LA 4 days after contracting the virus, showing 0 symptoms whatsoever and her dead body tested negative for covid, she died from a cerebral hemorrhage.</p>
      <p>新冠病毒可以影响呼吸系统以外的器官。武汉第一例病例脑髓液就测出了新冠病毒。核酸和其他检测方式至多50%有效，多例无症状感染者可因新冠而脑出血死亡。疫苗针对最新的奥米克隆变种几乎完全无效。LA女人病例，尸体核酸阴性，且感染病毒后四天内完全无症状暴毙，死因是脑出血。</p>
      <p>Stay safe.</p>

      <h5>Raining</h5> 
      <p>Aaaaand of course it rains today when everyone thinks the snow can finally pile up for a bit.</p>
      <p>Went to someone else's place (海平阿姨) with some friends today for Lunch. Got really bored later because there were literally nothing to do, so I finished my daily dose of philosophy course there instead. Finally moved on to communism and socialism, the course isn't too biased.</p>
      <p>Prepped some debate after I got home. Dinner is leftover pizza. Tried K3 for the first time in a while, got destroyed, but its possible. Next goal is K3 but with shorter breaks.</p>
      <p>The anime yesterday really made me consider some life choices. I really miss the times when I'm younger, and I realized just how much I've been wasting my time.</p>
      <p>First day in 2022. At least I'll have a chance to change. Life is much less desirable now when compared to 10 years or even 5 years ago, but I still have a chance to change. Gotta enjoy life as is. I bet 5 or 10 years later I'll be looking back and be envious of myself right now.</p>
      <p>Obviously, this is not to say that my life is desirable or enjoyable. However, as things only go downhill, I might as well take what I can and keep it in my memory.</p>
      <p>So yeah. That anime was really good btw. Its name is Erased（只有我不在的街道）, if you didn't see the third entry.</p>

      <h5>Cloudy</h5> 
      <p>Helped my dad clean the back yard of snow this morning. Fixed some issues with the blog. Finished correcting philosophy essays. Did some further research regarding debate.</p>
      <p>Played minecraft. Watched anime, which I will get to in a bit. Dinner was veggie pizza and meat, delicious as always.</p>
      <p>The debate topic this time ("This House would support a ban on cryptocurrency") is sort of hard to prep for. I have no idea what crypto is, but now I generally have something along the lines of a case. Talking to Shreyas, my partner, on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Regarding the anime, it's called Erased（只有我不在的街道）, recommended by Umar. It was really good. Finished it in an afternoon, about 12 episodes. The plot was near perfect.</p>
      <p>还有你们能不能别再说什么范式狂喜，牛头人之类的啊，这东西跟牛头人根本不沾边好吧，怎么看八代和男主都没什么浪漫感情啊，差不多一点啊你们这些人，我都哭了然后看评论区全是“牛头人”真的很破坏气氛啊喂</p>
      <p>Happy new year! Next year I'll be someone else. I will work harder. I will push myself harder. Most importantly, I'll be a better person. Those are my resolutions.</p>
      <br><p>Oh and also, I feel like I can start doing the K3 from the Keep App tomorrow in temrs of physical exercise.</p>

      <p>Sleepy as heck, tried for an afternoon to add pages to this website and failed. Formatting error. Guess I'll use collapse instead for now.</p>
      <p>Did some more philosophy work and carried on with my daily routine. All should be good. Driving class got cancelled because teacher was sick. Hopefully its not CoVID.</p>

      <p>Hopefully the blog gives me someone to talk to.</p>
      <p>Finished some stuff in my philosophy course. Carried on my daily routine.</p>
      <p>Dinner was delicious. Ate some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanghulu" target="_blank">Chinese dessert</a>, maybe I need to work out more.</p>
      <p>Finished the book Mao's Great Famine. Have a few opinions on it that I need to tell McEvoy.</p>
      <p>Expecting to finish the current unit of the philosophy course during the winter break.</p><br>
      <p>Oh and HTML compiles top to bottom, doesn't read the entire script beforehand. Got stuck on the header issue for like 1 hour because of this.</p>
